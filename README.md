# This Cute World / Ryan4Yin's Space

My personal blog, built using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and hosted on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard/usage) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Address: https://thiscute.world/

## Editing

Use the `new` command to create a new post:

```shell
# new posts
hugo new posts/2024/Q3/my-first-post/index.md
```

Launch a local Hugo server including live reload by running:

```shell
# serve with all drafts
hugo server --buildDrafts --disableFastRender

# serve in production mode
hugo serve -e production --disableFastRender

# or serve using the static files generated in production mode
# need to install caddy first
caddy file-server --root public/ --listen 0.0.0.0:8881
```

Now edit the newly created file under `content/posts`, and then you can view the live
changes in the browser <http://localhost:1313/>

## GitHub Action

Push updates to `main` branch will trigger a GitHub action to deploy the updates
automatically.

The action workflow will:

- Fetch Posts Trending Data from Google
  Analytics([website_statistics.json](./data/website_statistics.json)).
- Deploy to GitHub Pages(branch `gh-page`).
- Push Argolia Index for Search.

See [.github/workflows/](/.github/workflows/) for details.

## Process Posts

on NixOS, cd into the project root directory will automatically enter a nix devShell with
all the dependencies installed, this is done by `direnv`.

if you do not have `direnv` installed, you can also manually enter the devShell by
running:

```shell
nix develop
```

then process posts by running:

```shell
python3 process_posts.py
```
