 &lt;a href="#gossip" class="header-mark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gossip&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed in the twinkling of an eye, and this New year, the global epidemic
has set a new record. After Christmas, the daily increase in the United States has
directly exceeded 1 million. In China, poor management in Xi&amp;rsquo;an has led to hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has been for more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the point, after leaving from W Company at the beginning of this year, I was very
lucky to join the current company, Mobiuspace, and I was mixed in the process of
integrating into Mobiuspace. However, I am quite satisfied with the overall results, the
current work has been on the right track, but also found a lot of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
