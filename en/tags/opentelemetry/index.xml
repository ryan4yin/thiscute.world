 &lt;a href="#preface" class="header-mark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After resigning at the end of January, I spent time at home for the Chinese New Year, then
traveled around Shanghai, Zhangjiajie, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Nanjing. I didn&amp;rsquo;t return to
Shenzhen to start job hunting until mid-April. Initially, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I would have
time to attend KubeCon China 2025 in June. However, I was fortunate that the company I
received an offer from highly values technology. During the interview, my leader mentioned
seeing my KubeCon experiences in my blog and said the company strongly encourages
participation in such technical exchange events, even supporting giving talks with full
