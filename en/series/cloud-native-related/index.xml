    <a href="#preface" class="header-mark"></a>Preface</h2><p>After resigning at the end of January, I spent time at home for the Chinese New Year, then
traveled around Shanghai, Zhangjiajie, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Nanjing. I didn&rsquo;t return to
Shenzhen to start job hunting until mid-April. Initially, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would have
time to attend KubeCon China 2025 in June. However, I was fortunate that the company I
received an offer from highly values technology. During the interview, my leader mentioned
seeing my KubeCon experiences in my blog and said the company strongly encourages
participation in such technical exchange events, even supporting giving talks with full
expense coverage.</p>
<p>So, less than a month after joining, I went on a company-funded trip to KubeCon China 2025

    <a href="#preface" class="header-mark"></a>Preface</h2><p>I had known for a while that KubeCon China would be held in Hong Kong this year, and while
I was interested, I initially got deterred by the steep price of KubeCon tickets.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to believe in the magic of luck. By a twist of fate, I learned
about KubeCon&rsquo;s &lsquo;End User Ticket Program&rsquo; from my friend @Kev and snagged a ticket for
free. I also invited three friends from the <a href="https://0xffff.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xFFFF Community</a>,<a href="https://0xffff.one/u/Chever-John" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Chever-John</a>,<a href="https://0xffff.one/u/0xdeadbeef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@0xdeadbeef</a>, and<a href="https://0xffff.one/u/MingLLuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MingLLuo</a>, to join in. We rented an Airbnb in Hong Kong,
explored quite a few places in the city, and had a fruitful trip.</p>

  <p>I also tried to invite other friends and colleagues, but they couldn&rsquo;t make it for
various reasons, which was a bit of a bummer.</p>
