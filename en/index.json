Is this true? Firstly, let’s clarify that NixOS has a vast number of packages. In terms of size, Nixpkgs is on par with Arch Linux’s AUR. Repository statistics show that: Although the total number of packages in Nixpkgs may include some “fake” packages due to the inclusion of npm packages and others, even excluding these, the number of packages should be roughly similar to that of AUR. Moreover, because Nixpkgs is the official package repository and uses a Monorepo and PR Review system, the overall package quality is undoubtedly better than that of AUR. As you can see from the screenshot, Nixpkgs packages are generally more up-to-date and have fewer vulnerabilities than AUR packages. This is also where NixOS differs from Arch: Arch’s official package repository has strict inclusion criteria, while its AUR ecosystem is quite vibrant. Anyone can upload content to AUR, although there is a voting mechanism that serves as a certain level of review, the criteria are quite loose. NixOS, on the other hand, is quite different. Its official package repository, Nixpkgs, is quite open to new packages, and it’s relatively easier to add a package or feature to Nixpkgs compared to other distributions. This is one of the direct reasons why Nixpkgs’ size is close to AUR (GitHub shows that Nixpkgs has over 5000 historical contributors, which is quite astonishing). NixOS actually also has a NUR (Nix User Repository) similar to AUR, but because of Nixpkgs’ lax attitude, NUR doesn’t have much content. For example, you can directly download and use QQ(an IM App popular in China) from the Nixpkgs official package repository, while on Arch, you would need to use AUR or archlinux-cn. This can be seen as having its own advantages. NixOS is criticized for having too few packages mainly because it does not follow the FHS standard, which means that most Linux programs downloaded online cannot run directly on NixOS. Of course, there are solutions to this. I suggest first checking if there is already a package for the desired software in Nixpkgs, and if so, use it directly. If not, try some community solutions or package it yourself. Packaging programs is inevitable when using NixOS, as even though Nixpkgs already has a vast number of packages, it’s impossible for it to match all your needs 100% of the time. There will always be packages you want to use but can’t find in Nixpkgs or NUR, and on NixOS, you often have to write a packaging script for your packages to run normally on the system. OK, enough chatter. Let’s move on to the main topic. Firstly, NixOS is much more complex than traditional distributions and has a lot of historical issues. For example, the official documentation is so bad that it forced me, a beginner at NixOS, to write my own beginner’s notes while I was learning. After translating my notes into poor English and posting them on reddit (NixOS \u0026 Nix Flakes - A Guide for Beginners ), they received a lot of positive feedback from foreigners (after so much continuous iteration, it has now become one of the most popular beginner tutorials in the community), which also shows how bad the official documentation is.

In my view, it all comes down to scale. Here, “scale” refers to three aspects: The scale of your custom content for the Linux system: The more customization you do, the harder it is to migrate to a new version. The frequency of system updates: The more frequently you update your system, the higher the risk of encountering issues. The number of your Linux machines: The more machines you have, the more you benefit from a system that can easily replicate the same environment. Let me share my experience with traditional distributions like Arch and Ubuntu, and why I chose NixOS, and the changes it brought me, from a personal perspective. For example, when I used Deepin, Ubuntu and other traditional distros in the past, I didn’t customize the system much for fear of causing problems and not being able to fix them easily. Moreover, any customizations I made were black boxes and not migratable. A month later, I would have forgotten everything, and the system would have become increasingly chaotic and opaque over time. If you’re using a rolling release distribution like Arch, the issues you encounter are generally minor. But with Ubuntu or Deepin, it’s rare for in-place upgrades to go smoothly, which means I had to re-customize everything on the new Ubuntu version. Worse yet, I might have forgotten what I did in the past, meaning I had to spend more time researching my system environment and how everything was installed and configured. This repetitive labor is very painful. Clearly, the more complex and customized the system, the harder it is to migrate to a new version. I think this is why rolling release distributions like Arch, Gentoo, and Fedora are so popular among Linux enthusiasts. Linux users who like to customize their systems mostly use these types of distributions. So can Arch or Fedora solve the problems completely? Obviously not. Firstly, they have a higher update frequency, which means you’re more likely to break something on your system. Of course, this is a small problem, as most Linux users now use btrfs or zfs file system snapshots for rollback in case of issues. Their fundamental problems, however, is: Your Arch system environment, file system snapshots, or virtual machine snapshots are still black boxes. They will become increasingly chaotic with continuous use and do not include the “knowledge” of how to build this environment from scratch, making them unexplainable. In my work, I’ve seen some “ancestral virtual machine snapshots” or “ancestral cloud server snapshots” where no one knows how the environment was set up, and each new person who takes over can only continue to pile on buffs, then pass the time bomb to the next person. This is like the game where people take turns adding water to a cup, and whoever adds water when it overflows is out of luck. Arch essentially requires you to follow its updates continuously, which means you must continuously maintain it. If you let a machine run stable for a year and then decide to update it, the risk of problems is quite high. If you then decide to set up a new Arch machine and restore the old environment, you’re back to the same problem — you have to figure out how to restore your customization process from the old environment, which is also not a pleasant task. Snapshots are strongly associated with the current hardware environment and are easily affected by various strange issues when used directly on different hardware machines, making them unmovable. Snapshots are large binary files, making them expensive to back up and share. Docker can solve some of these problems. Firstly, Docker container images can be fully described by Dockerfiles, meaning they are explainable, and the same environment can be replicated in different environments. This indicates that they are movable.

The popularity of Terraform, Kubernetes, and even Spring Boot, reflects this. NixOS’s declarative configuration is also like this, as it encapsulates the underlying implementation details and has a community responsible for updating and maintaining these lower-level encapsulations. This greatly reduces my cognitive load and frees up my productivity. Its reproducibility also alleviates my concerns about breaking the system. NixOS is built on top of Nix, a functional package manager, drawing its design philosophy from Eelco Dolstra’s paper The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model . “Purely functional” means it has no side effects, much like a mathematical function $y = f(x)$, where the same NixOS configuration file (input parameter $x$) always yields the same NixOS system environment (output $y$). This means that NixOS’s configuration declares the entire system’s state, OS as Code! As long as you have the source code of your NixOS system and it hasn’t been lost, modifying it, reviewing it, sharing the source code with others, or borrowing features from someone else’s source code is quite straightforward. You can easily copy other NixOS users’ system configurations to ensure you’ll get the same environment. In contrast, copying configurations from users of traditional distributions like Arch or Ubuntu is much more cumbersome, considering the various version differences and environmental peculiarities, leading to a high level of uncertainty.

This is because its design philosophy is quite different from traditional Linux distributions. However, this is also its advantage, as once you cross that threshold, you will find a whole new world. For example, reading the source code of Nixpkgs and submitting PRs to add features， add packages or fix bugs is a basic skill for NixOS users, and NixOS users who do this are quite common. This is both a deterrent that scares away new users and a ladder for Linux users who have chosen NixOS. Imagine that most Arch users (like me in the past) might have used Arch for several years but didn’t understand the underlying implementation details of Arch, nor did they package their own software. But with NixOS, diving into the source code becomes a norm, which also shows that understanding its implementation details is not difficult. I will illustrate this point from two aspects. First, Nix is a relatively simple language with very few syntax rules, far simpler than general-purpose languages like Java or Python. Therefore, engineers with some programming experience can master its syntax in just a few hours. With a bit more time, reading common Nix code shouldn’t be too difficult. Second, NixOS’s good declarative abstraction and modularization system divide the OS into many layers, allowing users to focus only on the current layer of abstraction while still having the option to dive deeper into the next layer to more freely implement the desired functions (The right to choose, in fact, also gives users the opportunity to understand NixOS progressively.). For example, new users can normally use NixOS just by understanding the top-level abstraction. When you want to implement some customizations, digging one level deeper into the abstraction (such as customizing some operations directly through systemd’s declarative parameters) is usually enough. If you are already a seasoned NixOS user and want to be more geeky, you can continue to delve deeper. In summary, understanding the source code in Nixpkgs or using Nix to package a few programs is not difficult, and each NixOS user with some experience can also be a NixOS packager.

People outside the Nix community might mainly hear about its dependency-conflicts-free, the ability to roll back at any time, and its powerful reproducibility. If you have actually used NixOS, you should also know about its other advantages: NixOS’s flakes feature allows you to lock the system to a specific state, and you can update it when you want to, even if it spans a year or two. NixOS does not force you to update your system frequently, you can choose to do this or not at all. Because the state of the system can be completely inferred from your NixOS configuration, it’s much easier to upgrade from a old version to the latest one. It’s always good to have a choice, I don’t like being forced, and neither do sysadmins or DevOps in companies. System updates have similar atomic properties to database transactions, which means your system updates either succeed or fail (usually without intermediate states). NixOS’s declarative configuration actually implements OS as Code, making these configurations very easy to share. You can simply copy the code for the desired functionality from other NixOS users into your system configuration, and you’ll get an identical environment. Beginner users can also easily learn a lot from others’ configurations. This is also why more and more users are using NixOS for Linux desktop ricing on GitHub and reddit r/unixporn in recent years. The declarative configuration provides users with highly convenient system customization capabilities, allowing them to quickly switch various components of the system by changing a few lines of configuration. And so on. These are all selling points of NixOS, some of which can now also be achieved by traditional distributions with innovations like Fedora Silverblue. However, the system that can solve all these problems right now is only NixOS (and the more niche Guix, which also relies on the Nix package manager).

NixOS is very special and powerful, but on the other hand, it has a considerable amount of historical debt, such as: Poorly organized and impenetrable documentation The Flakes feature, which truly enables NixOS to meet its claimed reproducibility, is still in an experimental state from its official release in 2021(Nix 2.4) to 2024 now.. The Nix CLI is in a transition period, and the new version is much more elegant, but its implementation is strongly bound to the Flakes feature, making both difficult to stabilize and even hindering the development of many other features. Defects in the module system and insufficient error handling in Nix have led to long-term cryptic error messages, driving users crazy. The Nix language’s simplicity has resulted in a large number of Bash scripts being used in Nixpkgs, and most of Nix’s features are implemented in C++, making it a black box from the perspective of Nix. Many implementation details of NixOS are hidden in the Nixpkgs source code, such as the classification of software packages and what attributes can be overridden in derivations. Nixpkgs has long used folders to classify software packages, and there is no way to query the software packages by category except through the source code. All derivation-related information in Nixpkgs can currently only be obtained by looking at the source code. The maintainer of the https://nixos.wiki site has left, and the official has long failed to provide an alternative, making NixOS’s documentation even worse than it already was. The recent rapid growth of Nix/NixOS’s user base has posed challenges to its community operation model. … These historical debts are the main reasons why NixOS has not been more widely used. But these issues are also opportunities for NixOS’s future, as the community is actively working to solve them. I am looking forward to seeing how NixOS will develop once these issues are resolved.

Am I optimistic about it? Here, I try to illustrate my views on the future of NixOS using some data. First, let’s look at the Nixpkgs project, which stores all the software packages for NixOS and the implementation code for NixOS itself: The graph shows that the activity of the Nixpkgs project has been continuously increasing since 2021. Among the Top 6 contributors, three began contributing code in large quantities after 2021. If you look at GitHub, you’ll see that five out of the Top 10 contributors joined the community after 2021, including seasoned NixOS-CN members @NickCao and @figsoda. Now let’s look at the commit history of the Nix package manager, which is the underlying technology of NixOS: The graph shows a significant increase in activity in the Nix project in 2020, five of the top 6 contributors beginning to contribute code in large quantities after 2020. Next, let’s look at the Google Trends for the keyword “NixOS”: This graph shows several obvious upticks in the search trending for NixOS: In December 2021 This is likely due to the release of Nix 2.4 in November 2021, which brought experimental Flakes features and a new CLI. Flakes greatly improves the reproducibility of NixOS,and the new CLI is more in line with user intuition. In June 2023 The most important reason should be that several popular Linux-related channels on YouTube launched several videos about NixOS around this time. As of 2024-02-23, the three NixOS-related videos with the highest views on YouTube were all released between June and July 2023, with a total view count exceeding 1.3 million. Interest in China peaked recently, which may be because the user base in China has always been small. Then in June, I released NixOS and Flakes - An Unofficial Beginner’s Guide , and I did some promotion through channels like Technology Lover’s Weekly , leading to a significant increase in the relative index of NixOS. In January 2024 I’m not sure of the reason for this yet. Now let’s look at the annual user survey started by the Nix/NixOS community in 2022. 2022 Nix Survey Results , based on the data: 74.5% of users began using Nix/NixOS within the last three years. In the survey about extending Nixpkgs, 36.7% of users use Flakes to extend Nixpkgs, second only to traditional overlays. Nix Community Survey 2023 Results , a simple calculation reveals: 54.1% of users began using Nix/NixOS within the last three years. In the survey about extending Nixpkgs, the percentage of users using Flakes reached 49.2%, surpassing traditional Overlays. In the survey about experimental features, the percentage of users using Flakes reached 59.1%. Additionally, GitHub’s Octoverse 2023 report also mentioned Nixpkgs: Developers see benefits to combining packages and containerization. As we noted earlier, 4.3 million repositories used Docker in 2023. On the other side of the coin, Linux distribution NixOS/nixpkgs has been on the top list of open source projects by contributor for the last two years. These data points align with the increased activity in the Nixpkgs and Nix projects and show that the Nix/NixOS community began growing rapidly after 2021. Considering all these data points, I am very optimistic about the future of NixOS.

Based on my personal experience with these niche technologies, they share some notable common characteristics. Firstly, they have a common downside: higher learning curve and more time required to get familiar with them during the initial stages. This filters out the majority of users, and only those who enjoy tinkering and embracing challenges will be willing to explore these niche technologies. For instance, with the Dvorak keyboard layout, the learning curve is steep, requiring a significant amount of time to memorize the key arrangement and practice, leading to a challenging input experience in the early stages. To achieve the typing speed you had with the QWERTY keyboard layout, you might need to practice Dvorak for at least an hour a day consistently for a month. Now, let’s discuss their common advantages: High customizability: Users can freely customize various functions according to their needs. Strong sense of control and excellent user experience: The high level of customization gives users a sense of complete control while using these technologies, resulting in an excellent user experience. High user retention and active communities: Users continuously explore, learn, and customize these technologies, creating a strong sense of belonging within the communities. Due to these reasons, once users successfully familiarize themselves with a niche technology (e.g., dvorak keyboard layout, Neovim/Emacs editors), it becomes challenging for them to revert to the previous mainstream solutions. They will find the previous solutions less convenient and enjoyable.

However, I am quite satisfied with the overall results, the current work has been on the right track, but also found a lot of opportunities.

I suddenly felt open-minded and changed my mindset 180 degrees. It was great, but I was actually very worried about my shortcomings in all aspects. Anyway, I’m in a complicated mood. I talked a lot with @是格子啊 , @Cheese and former colleagues). Thank you very much for helping me sort out my thoughts and giving me an affirmation. At the same time, I was recommended by @Cheese and started using twitter. I climbed the mountain every day to see the scenery, bought a hammock to take a nap in the park, practiced the harmonica and bamboo flute, and played like this for a month. In March, I started looking for a job. After meeting with several companies, I was very lucky to enter Mobiuspace and became a new SRE. The experience of a year in Mobiuspace is written in the “work” section, which is skipped here. At the end of March, I watched the movie “Raya and The Last Dragon” (the only movie I watched in 2021), and the ending song was very good. In April, by various coincidences, I unexpectedly found that my junior high school classmate’s residence was less than one kilometer away from me. I had a meal of hometown food and bayberry wine at his house. It tasted very good! In August, my two cousin came to Shenzhen for a summer internship. I crossed Shenzhen’s east-west coastline with them. The scenery was great, but we were really hot and thirsty on the way. In October Joined Mobiuspace’s surfing team, surfing and have a seaside barbecue for the first time. Bought roller skates, learned reverse skating and step steering, and reviewed some basic skills learned in college. In December, Bought a YunMi RO Filterred Water Dispenser, and many kinds of tea. Currently I prefer to drink Black Tea, such as Dianhong - Yunnan Gold, Redsunion Keemun.

I read more than half of the book “From Lost to Found the Pacific Crest Trail”. In June, the community organized us to get vaccinated against COVID-19, I read the book “Youth Post Station - A Portrait of Working Girls in Shenzhen” in the waiting room, which is mainly about the lives of working girls in the 1980s and 1990s. The writing is very real and the feelings are very delicate. At the end of the year, my second grandfather died. After attending the funeral, I vaguely found some profound changes in my mind. I finished reading “Moon Palace”, which tells the tragic life of the protagonist. Most of the rest of my spare time, boring, do not want to learn anything, do not want to exercise, so I read a lot of web novels to pass the time.

I felt like I was out of luck. After all, Mobiuspace, whether it is the level of colleagues or the working atmosphere, or the number of customers, compared with my last company is qualitatively different. My first station in Mobiuspace After getting familiar with the contents and methods of the work, leader tried his best to give me the work that best matched my interests, helping me solve problems, and at the same time giving me great autonomy, which was really great. However, a high degree of autonomy also brings higher difficulty in work. I have been in a hurry, confused, and even self-doubted when I encounter difficulties. I am worried about whether I will run away the next day. But fortunately, I still have the ability to adjust my mindset, take responsibility and finish the work step by step. When there were several delays in my work, leader accompanied me to work overtime. After the work was done, he took me to a big dinner to reward myself. I really thanked him for his help and support. My new station, near the floor-to-ceiling window, the view is great. Looking back at the summary and outlook for 2020, I find that the actual progress this year is very different from what I expected last year. The initial goal was only about 10% achieved, but because I was exposed to a lot of unexpected things, I was generally satisfied: It is a great gain to be familiar with the culture and working style of the new company - Mobiuspace, and my working style has been greatly improved. Contact and be familiar with Mobiuspace’s AWS online environment Responsible for maintaining the online Kubernetes management platform, the first time I came into contact with the online cluster peak QPS was tens of thousands. It is of great significance that I have changed from being careful at the beginning to becoming a veteran now. Using python to write several Kubernetes management platform services, this is also my first time to write online services, quite a sense of achievement In the second half of the year, I spent a lot of energy on the analysis and control of AWS cost, and got some good results, which benefited a lot. Learned the simple use of Nginx, just enough to maintain the company’s pre-existing Nginx proxy configuration. Lead the completion of “create a new K8s cluster and migrate the services to the new cluster”. Although it is not a very difficult thing, but this should be my greatest achievement in 2021. I also encountered all kinds of problems in the process of upgrading. When I first upgraded and migrated, I prepared for a long time and panicked. As a result, there was still something wrong with some of the services during the upgrade. I was really confused at that time. Casually wrote a few demo of Go, and made little progress. Learning the rust language for a week, quickly finished reading The Book, and rewrote a video2chars in rust Learned the underlying principle of Linux container: cgroups/namespace technology, and implemented a demo with go/rust Learned various network interfaces and iptables of Linux Be familiar with PromQL/Grafana If I give myself a score, it’s “good”. Because I am not very enterprising, so the result can not be called “excellent”. By the way, the new office of Mobiuspace is really great.

Thinking about whether to continue to invest in Istio or to switch to other options. Service Mesh is still evolving rapidly, and the future trend should be eBPF + Envoy + WASM. Cilium’s eBPF-based Service Mesh is a new trend (it falls back to Per-Node Proxy mode when using advanced features). It’s expected to hit other Service Mesh of Sidecar mode in terms of cost and delay. As for the log of K8s cluster, we currently use a self-developed system based on gelf protocol, but there are a lot of problems. From the point of view of improving the maintainability and ease of use of the log system, loki is worth exploring. In terms of K8s cluster management, I think the upgrade iteration of the cluster can be done more automatically and reliably. Next year, we can explore more in the direction of multi-cluster management. Pod Service Quality : For non-core services, the amount of requests resources can be appropriately reduced instead of fully reserved (Guaranteed) to improve resource utilization. The official HPA capability is not enough. Our developers needs to scale the services based on QPS/Queue or other parameters. We should continue to promote the landing of KEDA . In terms of cost control, I realized the benefits of ARM architecture and AWS Spot EC2. There is a lot of potential room for optimization of cross-area traffic cost.

My technical articles are mainly used to sort out the knowledge I don’t understand yet. I only write about things that I haven’t fully mastered yet. As for the things I am proficient in, I usually have no incentive to write related articles. Showing off has never been my motivation to write. Curiosity is.” ──阮一峰 I started writing blogs in 2016, and it’s been many years now. I’ve experimented with various writing platforms, but ultimately, I chose to create my own website. This choice grants me full control and the highest degree of freedom. My articles won’t be deleted or blocked without reason. Additionally, there are many free static site hosting services available (such as GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.), which essentially require no monetary investment. Whether it’s a lifestyle blog or a technical blog, every blogger has their own objectives. My purpose for blogging has changed many times. Initially, I simply wanted to try out new things. Later, I aimed to gain more readership and comments because they provided a strong sense of accomplishment. Subsequently, I used my blog as a technical notebook and diary, jotting down numerous miscellaneous thoughts. Now, my primary goal for blogging is to use it as a tool to organize and construct my knowledge framework. My blog, along with my personal notes repository ryan4yin/knowledge , serves as my treasure trove of knowledge. As I continually add new content, I find myself increasingly reliant on it for my daily work and even leisure activities. My secondary objective is to share the knowledge I acquire with those who need it, embracing the joy of helping others. Lastly, I use blogging to document myself—my joys, sorrows, and personal growth. I’ve purchased domain names for the longest duration of ten years, and renewing them every few years. I hope this blog will accompany me for a very long time. Looking back at my blog in the next decade and reflecting on the path I’ve walked over these ten years, I believe that time will hold special significance.
