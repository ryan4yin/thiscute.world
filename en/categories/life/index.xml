NixOS, window manager i3/hyprland, and Neovim. NixOS, in particular, took me to a whole
new level - I even created an open-source bilingual book&lt;a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-and-flakes-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nixos-and-flakes-book&lt;/a&gt; to help
beginners get started. Additionally, I worked on several NixOS-related open-source
projects like &lt;a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nix-darwin-kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ryan4yin/nix-config&lt;/a&gt;, which all received
positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experiences with these niche technologies and the frequent questions I receive
(e.g., why did I choose &lt;a href="nixos.org/" rel=""&gt;NixOS&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt; /&lt;a href="https://flypy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Flypy Chinese Input Method&lt;/a&gt;? What are their advantages? Can they
really improve productivity?), I would like to briefly share my thoughts on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Summary of My 2021</title><link>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/2021-summary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/2021-summary/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="gossip" class="headerLink"&gt;
 &lt;a href="#gossip" class="header-mark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gossip&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed in the twinkling of an eye, and this New year, the global epidemic
has set a new record. After Christmas, the daily increase in the United States has
directly exceeded 1 million. In China, poor management in Xi&amp;rsquo;an has led to hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has been for more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the point, after leaving from W Company at the beginning of this year, I was very
lucky to join the current company, Mobiuspace, and I was mixed in the process of
integrating into Mobiuspace. However, I am quite satisfied with the overall results, the
current work has been on the right track, but also found a lot of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The End of Another Semester</title><link>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/the-end-of-another-semester/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 01:28:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/the-end-of-another-semester/</guid><description>&lt;!-- Love Story - The Piano Guys --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, there are still ten days to get rid of the city and return to that reassuring mountain
forest, waiting and anxious, wondering why the remaining ten days are so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final review is a mess again. I am really lazy&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so unrealistic for me to have such a big dream that I have finished thousands of
lines of code. I kind of want to accept my fate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
