 &lt;a href="#preface" class="header-mark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After resigning at the end of January, I spent time at home for the Chinese New Year, then
traveled around Shanghai, Zhangjiajie, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Nanjing. I didn&amp;rsquo;t return to
Shenzhen to start job hunting until mid-April. Initially, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I would have
time to attend KubeCon China 2025 in June. However, I was fortunate that the company I
received an offer from highly values technology. During the interview, my leader mentioned
seeing my KubeCon experiences in my blog and said the company strongly encourages
participation in such technical exchange events, even supporting giving talks with full
expense coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, less than a month after joining, I went on a company-funded trip to KubeCon China 2025
in Hong Kong (:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I asked my colleagues if they were interested, but for various reasons, I ended up being
the only one attending (sad&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a href="#preface" class="header-mark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had known for a while that KubeCon China would be held in Hong Kong this year, and while
I was interested, I initially got deterred by the steep price of KubeCon tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just have to believe in the magic of luck. By a twist of fate, I learned
about KubeCon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;End User Ticket Program&amp;rsquo; from my friend @Kev and snagged a ticket for
free. I also invited three friends from the &lt;a href="https://0xffff.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;0xFFFF Community&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://0xffff.one/u/Chever-John" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;@Chever-John&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://0xffff.one/u/0xdeadbeef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;@0xdeadbeef&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="https://0xffff.one/u/MingLLuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;@MingLLuo&lt;/a&gt;, to join in. We rented an Airbnb in Hong Kong,
explored quite a few places in the city, and had a fruitful trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I also tried to invite other friends and colleagues, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it for
various reasons, which was a bit of a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

The beginner notes I
wrote initially have received a lot of positive feedback and some sponsorships, becoming
one of the most popular entry-level tutorials in the entire community. Since I created a
dedicated GitHub repository and a separate documentation site for it in June 2023, it has
garnered 1189 stars, and besides me, 37 other readers have submitted PRs:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why do I explore these niche technologies?</title><link>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/why-i-choose-niche-products/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 11:40:57 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/why-i-choose-niche-products/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have dabbled with many niche technologies, and this year, the main ones I explored are
NixOS, window manager i3/hyprland, and Neovim. NixOS, in particular, took me to a whole
new level - I even created an open-source bilingual book&lt;a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-and-flakes-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nixos-and-flakes-book&lt;/a&gt; to help
beginners get started. Additionally, I worked on several NixOS-related open-source
projects like &lt;a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nix-darwin-kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ryan4yin/nix-config&lt;/a&gt;, which all received
positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experiences with these niche technologies and the frequent questions I receive
(e.g., why did I choose &lt;a href="nixos.org/" rel=""&gt;NixOS&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt; /&lt;a href="https://flypy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Flypy Chinese Input Method&lt;/a&gt;? What are their advantages? Can they
really improve productivity?), I would like to briefly share my thoughts on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NixOS &amp; Nix Flakes - A Guide for Beginners</title><link>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/nixos-and-flake-basics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 21:23:28 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/nixos-and-flake-basics/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since the article is so long now, for the convenience of readers, the content of this post

 &lt;a href="#gossip" class="header-mark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gossip&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed in the twinkling of an eye, and this New year, the global epidemic
has set a new record. After Christmas, the daily increase in the United States has
directly exceeded 1 million. In China, poor management in Xi&amp;rsquo;an has led to hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has been for more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the point, after leaving from W Company at the beginning of this year, I was very
lucky to join the current company, Mobiuspace, and I was mixed in the process of
integrating into Mobiuspace. However, I am quite satisfied with the overall results, the
current work has been on the right track, but also found a lot of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
